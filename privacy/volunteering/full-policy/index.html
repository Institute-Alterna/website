                <h1>Privacy Policy for Volunteering Program</h1>
        </header>
        <main>
                <p>Institute Alterna (hereafter referred to as &quot;the Organization&quot;), along with
                        its associates and volunteers, is committed to safeguarding your privacy and ensuring the security of
                        your
                        personal information.</p>
                <p>This privacy policy outlines the information collected by the Organization from
                        prospective and current volunteers, how it is used, and how it is protected. By submitting your
                        information
                        to the Organization, you agree to the terms of this policy.</p>
                <h2>Before Joining</h2>
                <p>The Organization collects minimal personal information from prospective volunteers,
                        such as name, email address, school grade, school name, area of interest, and previous experience. This
                        is
                        done when a prospective volunteer expresses interest in the program and submits an initial Google Form
                        requesting contact from the Organization.</p>
                <p>We contact prospective volunteers through live video conference calls using Google
                        Meet, which may be recorded for quality assurance purposes. Before recording, all participants will be
                        notified and asked for consent. Prospective volunteers, associates, and other participants in the video
                        call
                        can decide not to provide consent without any repercussions.</p>
                <h2>When Joining</h2>
                <p>Once a prospective volunteer has been accepted into the program, the Organization
                        collects further information using a Volunteering Agreement to create the volunteer&#39;s record in our
                        systems. Volunteers are asked to provide additional information such as the entity they represent, their
                        internal identification number at the entity they represent, timezone, preferred times of contact,
                        volunteering report preference, and more.</p>
                <p>Volunteers provide this information willingly to help us keep track of their
                        community service hours and other statistics related to their participation. We also collect data from
                        our
                        meetings, whether they are in-person or virtual. We aim to collect only the minimal amount of
                        information
                        required to procure associate&rsquo;s privacy and their overall success on the project.</p>
                <h2>During and After Participation</h2>
                <p><strong>Explicit Consent:</strong>&nbsp;By submitting their data through our
                        Volunteering Agreement, volunteers explicitly agree that their data will be stored and used solely for

                <p><strong>Data Retention Period:</strong>&nbsp;Associates&#39; data will be kept
                        for an undisclosed amount of time after the resignation of their stay within the project.</p>
                <p><strong>Data Access:</strong>&nbsp;Volunteers&#39; data will only be accessed
                        by management associates when explicitly required for project-related purposes.</p>
                <p><strong>Security Measures</strong>:&nbsp;We have implemented highly strict
                        measures to protect all data collected from unauthorized access, disclosure, or misuse. While we cannot
                        disclose our specific security measures and practices for confidentiality reasons, rest assured that we

                        Reports.</p>
                <p><strong>Data Portability:</strong>&nbsp;Individuals may also request their
                        data in a portable, openly readable format if needed. Contact our Chief Data Officer for assistance.

                        informing individuals in case of a data breach in our systems, and will look after protecting their
                        information.</p>
                <p>We remain committed to respecting the privacy of the people related to our mission by
                        asking for consent and collecting only the necessary information. As we continue to grow and expand our
                        programs, we will regularly evaluate our data practices to ensure that we are aligned with the highest
                        standards of data security and privacy.</p>
